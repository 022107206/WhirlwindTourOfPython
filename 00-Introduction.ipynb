    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceived in the late 1980s as a teaching and scripting language, Python has since become an essential tool for many programmers, engineers, researchers, and data scientists across academia and industry.\n",
    "As an astronomer focused on building and promoting the free open tools for data-intensive science, I've found Python to be a near-perfect fit for the types of problems I face day to day, whether it's extracting meaning from large astronomical datasets, scraping and munging data sources from the web, or automating day-to-day research tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The appeal of Python is in its simplicity and beauty, as well as the convenience of the large ecosystem of domain-specific tools that have been built on top of it.\n",
    "For example most of the Python code in scientific computing and data science is built around a group of mature and useful packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [NumPy](http://numpy.org) provides efficient storage and computation for multi-dimensional data arrays.\n",
    "- [SciPy](http://scipy.org) contains a wide array of numerical tools such as numerical integration and interpolation.\n",
    "- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) provides a dataframe object along with a powerful set of methods to manipulate, filter, group, and transform data.\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) provides a useful interface for creation of publication-quality plots and figures.\n",
    "- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) provides a uniform toolkit for applying common machine learning algorithms to data.\n",
    "- [IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) provides an enhanced terminal and an interactive notebook environment that is useful for exploratory analysis, as well as creation of interactive, executable documents. For example, this manuscript was composed entirely in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "No less important are the numerous other tools and packages which accompany these: if there is a scientific or data analysis task you want to perform, chances are someone has written a package that will do it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tap into the power of this data science ecosystem, however, requires first familiarity with the Python language itself.\n",
    "I often encounter students and colleagues who have (sometimes extensive) background in computing in some language – MatLab, IDL, R, Java, C++, etc. – and are looking for a brief but comprehensive tour of the Python language that respects their level of knowledge rather than starting from ground zero.\n",
    "This report seeks to fill that niche.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, this report in no way aims to be a comprehensive introduction to programming, or a full introduction to the Python language itself; if that is what you are looking for, you might check out one of the recommended references listed in the final section.\n",
    "Instead, this will provide a whirlwind tour of some of Python's essential syntax and semantics, built-in data types and structures, function definitions, control flow statements, and other aspects of the language.\n",
    "My aim is that readers will walk away with a solid foundation from which to explore the data science stack outlined above."

    "## Installation and Practical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 2 vs Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "This book uses the syntax of Python 3, which contains language enhancements which are not compatible with the 2.x series of Python.\n",
    "Though Python 3.0 was first released in 2008, adoption has been relatively slow, particularly in the scientific and web development communities.\n",
    "This is primarily because it took some time for many of the essential packages and toolkits to be made compatible with the new language internals.\n",
    "Since early 2014, however, stable releases of the most important tools in the data science ecosystem have been fully-compatible with both Python 2 and 3, and so this book will use the newer Python 3 syntax.\n",
    "Even though that is the case, the vast majority of code snippets in this book will also work without modification in Python 2: in cases where a Py2-incompatible syntax is used, I will make every effort to note it explicitly."

    "### Installation with ``conda``\n",
    "\n",
    "Though there are various ways to install Python, the one I would suggest – particularly if you wish to eventually use the data science tools mentioned above – is via the cross-platform Anaconda distribution.\n",
    "There are two flavors of the Anaconda distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) gives you Python interpreter itself, along with a command-line tool called ``conda`` which operates as a cross-platform package manager geared toward Python packages, similar in spirit to the ``apt`` or ``yum`` tools that Linux users might be familiar with.\n",
    "- [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) includes both Python and ``conda``, and additionally bundles a suite of other pre-installed packages geared toward scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any of the packages included with Anaconda can also be installed manually on top of miniconda; for this reason I suggest starting with miniconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, download and install the miniconda package – make sure to choose a version with Python 3 – and then install the ``ipython-notebook`` package:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[~]$ conda install ipython-notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "For more information on ``conda``, including information about creating and using conda environments, refer to the ``conda`` package documentation linked at the above page."

    "## The Zen of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python afficianados are often quick to point out how \"intuitive\", \"beautiful\", or \"fun\" Python is.\n",
    "While I tend to agree, I also recognize that beauty, intuition, and fun often go hand-in-hand with familiarity, and so for those familiar with other languages such florid sentiments can come across as a bit smug.\n",
    "Nevertheless, I hope that if you give Python a chance, you'll see where such impressions might come from.\n",
    "And if you *really* want to dig-in to the programming philosophy that drives much of the coding practice of Python power-users, a nice little easter egg exists in the Python interpreter: simply close your eyes, meditate for a few minutes, and import ``this``:"
