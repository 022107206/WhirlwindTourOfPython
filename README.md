# WhirlwindTourOfPython

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks behind my OReilly report,
*A Whirlwind Tour of Python*.

*A Whirlwind Tour of Python* is a fast-paced introduction to essential
components of the Python language for researchers and developers who are
already familiar with programming in another language.

The material is particularly aimed at those who wish to use Python for data 
science and/or scientific programming, and in this capacity serves as an
introduction to my upcoming book, *The Python Data Science Handbook*.

The material here is adapted from lectures and workshops I've given on these
topics at University of Washington and at various conferences, meetings, and
workshops around the world.
